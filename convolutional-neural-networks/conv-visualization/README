CNNs are a kind of deep learning model that can learn to do things like image classification and object recognition. 
They keep track of spatial information and learn to extract features like the edges of objects in something called a convolutional layer.
Below you'll see an simple CNN structure, made of multiple layers, below, including this "convolutional layer".
